                <h3>What is Kanban?</h3>
                <p>Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. <br>
                    Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process.
                    <br>
                    The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can
                    flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.
                </p>
